# Sound Files

This directory contains notification sound files:

- `message.mp3` - Default message notification sound
- `call.mp3` - Incoming call notification sound  
- `notification.mp3` - General notification sound
- `default.mp3` - Fallback sound

To add actual sound files:
1. Add your sound files (MP3 format recommended) to this directory
2. Ensure they are named correctly as listed above
3. Keep file sizes small (under 100KB) for quick loading

For now, the app will gracefully handle missing sound files.
